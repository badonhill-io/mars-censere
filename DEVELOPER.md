Developer Guidelines
====================

Preferred Conduct
-----------------

* I (richard) personally don't like PEP8. As I'm getting older I'm
finding it harder to separate the characters at a glance, therefore
I prefer addition spacing (horizontal and vertical) to aid fast
assimulation.
* Don't reformat other peoples code unless you are chnaging it for other reasons
* Use the following import order
* * standard libraries (i.e. sys, os, logging)
* * third party additional libraries required for the application
* * local modules
* Try not to use import wildcards.
